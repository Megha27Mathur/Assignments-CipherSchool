            <center><div class="container">
                <p>My name is Megha Mathu.An enthusiast, determined and focused with a keen eye for details.<br>
                    I'm constantly learning new things everyday and love meeting people who are motivated and unafraid
                    of sharing their ideas with the world.<br><br>
                  .</p></center>

            <ul solid style="list-style-type: circle">
               <li><h3>Passion is Everything</h3></li>
                <p>If you don't enjoy what you're doing - move. You are not a tree. Channel your energy into something you believe
                    in. I'm fortunate to be inspired and surrounded by motivated people who enjoy what they do. We only have
                    so much time on this earth to live - so why waste it?</p>

               <li><h3>Always be Learning</h3></li>
               <p>Humans are constant works in progress that need to receive feedback in order to grow. I am always
                    looking at ways to challenge and improve myself, which is why in my spare time I like to participate
                     in h, read blogs, dabble in new projects and attend meetups.</p>

               <li><h3>Embrace your Creativity</h3></li>
               <p>Everyone needs a creative outlet of some sort - else, we'd go insane! When I'm not designing, I'm singing
                with the band, painting artworks as a form of meditation and helping startups realise their potential
                with design.</p>

                        Machine Learning (ML) is basically that field of computer science with the help of which computer systems can provide sense to data in much the same way as human beings do. In simple words, ML is a type of artificial intelligence that extract patterns out of raw data by using an algorithm or method. The key focus of ML is to allow computer systems to learn from experience without being explicitly programmed or human intervention.</span>


                     <span class="rect1"><h2>Programming Languages</h2>
                        A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output. Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.<br>
                        I'm good at Python,C,C++.</span>
